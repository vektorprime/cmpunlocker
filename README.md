## What is cmpunlocker?

<p>
  cmpunlocker restores numerous features that are restricted in firmware/OTP configuration of the NVIDIA CMP 170HX. cmpunlocker has been featured by multiple outlets like wccftech, Tom's Hardware and LinusTechTips.

## Proof of Concept

Below are memory and performance results after applying the unlock:

## Requirements

- Linux (x86-64)
- Root access
- NVIDIA CMP 170HX
- **nvidia-open 610.xx.xx+ already installed** (libs + firmware)
- Kernel headers matching the running kernel (`linux-headers-$(uname -r)` / `kernel-devel`)
- Secure Boot disabled (patched modules are unsigned)
- Network access on first install (downloads matching stock `open-gpu-kernel-modules` sources)
- Python 3 (used at build time to select 8GB/10GB geometry)

---

## Install

To install cmpunlocker, run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

To force a certain memory profile, use the `--profile` option:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --profile=8gb    # 8GB card → 64GB unlock
sudo ./install.sh --profile=10gb   # 10GB card → 40GB unlock
```

Then perform a reboot.

### 170tune compatibility (fork)

This fork additionally opens the FBPA privilege windows that live memory control needs —
something the upstream repo does not provide. Pair it with
[vektorprime/170tune](https://github.com/vektorprime/170tune) (`fbpa-first-active`):

- **8 GB (`0x20C2`)**: full windows — FBPA_MEM, broadcast FBPA_PLL0/1/2, and unicast
  FBPA0 PLL. The live NDIV lever, timings, and refresh all work (`preflight` green).
- **10 GB (`0x2082`)**: FBPA_MEM + broadcast FBPA_PLL0/1/2. The unicast FBPA0 row is
  skipped on this SKU — its window is orphaned in hardware (the SEC2 booter itself
  faults touching it, killing GSP init if forced). SM, timings, and refresh levers
  work; the 170tune fork drives the memory lever through the first live FBPA instead.

## Uninstall

To uninstall cmpunlocker, run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./remove.sh --yes
```

Then perform a reboot.
